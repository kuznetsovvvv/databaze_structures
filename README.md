# Databaze_structures

### Structure
The databaze was written in c++ programming language. And this project has three files: 1 header and 2 executable: Functions.h, Functions.cpp and databaze.cpp

### Possibilities
There are many functions here: enter data manually or from file, print, change data, delete data, copy objects, add data, sort, save.

### Technologies
I use structures from to add subjects. This allows you to organize the information about each subject in a structured way, making it easier to manage and access the data.
